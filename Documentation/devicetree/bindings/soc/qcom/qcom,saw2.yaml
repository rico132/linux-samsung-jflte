title: Qualcomm SPM AVS Wrapper 2 (SAW2)

description: |
  The SAW2 is a wrapper around the Subsystem Power Manager (SPM) and the
  Adaptive Voltage Scaling (AVS) hardware. The SPM is a programmable
  power-controller that transitions a piece of hardware (like a processor or
  subsystem) into and out of low power modes via a direct connection to
  the PMIC. It can also be wired up to interact with other processors in the
  system, notifying them when a low power state is entered or exited.

  Multiple revisions of the SAW hardware are supported using these Device Nodes.
  SAW2 revisions differ in the register offset and configuration data. Also, the
  same revision of the SAW in different SoCs may have different configuration
  data due the differences in hardware capabilities. Hence the SoC name, the
  version of the SAW hardware in that SoC and the distinction between cpu (big
  or Little) or cache, may be needed to uniquely identify the SAW register
  configuration and initialization data. The compatible string is used to
  indicate this parameter.
