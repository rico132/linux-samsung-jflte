title: Qualcomm SMD RPM Regulators

description:
  The Qualcomm RPM over SMD regulator is modelled as a subdevice of the RPM.
  Because SMD is used as the communication transport mechanism, the RPM
  resides as a subnode of the SMD.  As such, the SMD-RPM regulator requires
  that the SMD and RPM nodes be present.
